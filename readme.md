## Usage

If you are using [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber), you can also use the `SSR` component from [react-postprocessing](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-postprocessing). Check out the react-three-fiber demos to see how it's used there.
<br>

### Basic usage:

Install the package first:

```
npm i screen-space-reflections
```

Then add it to your code like so:

```javascript
import { SSREffect } from "screen-space-reflections"

const composer = new POSTPROCESSING.EffectComposer(renderer)

const ssrEffect = new SSREffect(scene, camera, options?)

const ssrPass = new POSTPROCESSING.EffectPass(camera, ssrEffect)

composer.addPass(ssrPass)
```

| refineSteps             | <code>Number</code>  | once we had our ray intersect something, we need to find the exact point in space it intersected and thus it reflects; this can be done through binary search with the given number of maximum steps                                    |
| missedRays              | <code>boolean</code> | if there should still be reflections for rays for which a reflecting point couldn't be found; enabling this will result in stretched looking reflections which can look good or bad depending on the angle                              |

| resolutionScale         | <code>Number</code>  | resolution of the SSR effect, a resolution of 0.5 means the effect will be rendered at half resolution                                                                                                                                  |

### ‚ùó Highly recommended: Use a GUI to tweak the options

Since the right options for an SSR effect depend a lot on the scene, it can happen that you don't seem to have an effect at all in your scene when you use the SSR effect for the first time in it without any configuration. This can have multiple causes such as `` being way too low for your scene for example. So to find out which SSR options are right for your scene, you should use a GUI to find the right values easily. The [example](https://github.com/0beqz/screen-space-reflections/tree/main/example) already comes with a simple one-file GUI [`SSRDebugGUI.js`](https://github.com/0beqz/screen-space-reflections/blob/main/example/SSRDebugGUI.js) that you can use in your project like so:

- First install the npm package of the module used for the GUI:

```
npm i tweakpane
```

- then just copy the `SSRDebugGUI.js` to your project and initialize it like so in your scene:

```javascript
import { SSRDebugGUI } from "./SSRDebugGUI"

const gui = new SSRDebugGUI(ssrEffect, options)
```

That's it, you should now have the GUI you can see in the [example scene](https://screen-space-reflections.vercel.app/). The `options` parameter is optional for the SSRDebugGUI and will default to the default options if no `options` parameter is given.

## Run Locally

If you'd like to test this project and run it locally, run these commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/0beqz/screen-space-reflections
cd screen-space-reflections/example
npm i --force
npm run dev
```

## Features

- Temporal Reprojection to re-use the last frame and thus reduce noise
- Jittering and blurring reflections to approximate rough reflections
- Using three.js' WebGLMultipleRenderTarget (WebGL2 only) to improve performance when rendering scene normals, depth and roughness
- Early out cases to compute only possible reflections and boost performance
- Box Blur to reduce noise

## What's new in v2

- Introduced Temporal Reprojection to reduce noise for the reflections when moving the camera by reprojecting the last frame's reflections into the current one
- Implemented accumulative sampling by saving and re-using the last frame's reflections to accumulate especially jittered reflections over frames
- Made all SSR-related options (e.g. `thickness`, `ior`, ``,...) reactive so that you now just need to set `ssrEffect. = value` for example to update values
- Fixed jittering so that it's actually correct from all angles (it used to be less intense the higher you were looking down at a reflection)
- Changed the SSR implementation from a pass to an effect to improve performance
- Optimizations regarding computation of required buffers and reflections

## Tips

<details>
  <summary>Expand to view tips</summary>
  
### Getting rid of artifacts

If you are getting artifacts, for example:

<br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0beqz/screen-space-reflections/screenshots//artifacts.jpg" width="50%">

Then try the following:

- increase `thickness`
- increase `maxDepthDifference`
- decrease ``and increase`steps` if reflections are cutting off now
- increase `refineSteps`

Keep in mind that increasing these values will have an impact on performance.
<br>

### Hiding missing reflections

Since SSR only works with screen-space information, there'll be artifacts when there's no scene information for a reflection ray.
This usually happens when another objects occludes a reflecting object behind it.
<br>
To make missing reflections less apparent, use an env-map that can then be used as a fallback when there is no reflection.
Ideally use a box-projected env-map.

Here are two implementations for three.js and react-three-fiber:

- [Gist to include box-projected env-maps in three.js](https://gist.github.com/0beqz/8d51b4ae16d68021a09fb504af708fca)
- [useBoxProjectedEnv in react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei#useboxprojectedenv)
  <br>

### Getting updated reflections for animated materials

By default, the SSR effect won't really update reflections if the camera is not moving and no mesh in the view is moving.
However, it will check if a mesh's material's map is a `VideoTexture` and will keep its reflections updated each frame.
If your material is not using a `VideoTexture` but is still animated (e.g. it's a custom animated shader material), then you can get updated reflections for it by setting
`mesh.material.userData.needsUpdatedReflections = true`. This will make the SSR effect recalculate its reflections each frame.

### Server Side Rendering and `window` being undefined

If you are using Server Side Rendering and don't have access to the `window` object then the SSR effect won't be able to set the correct width and height for its passes.
So once you have access to the `window` object, set the correct width and height of the SSR effect using:

```javascript
ssrEffect.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight)
```
